		<p>Hey, <b>I'm Dan.</b> I’m a brand advisor for 7-8 figure creators, influencers, and social media brands.
			I’m the guy they come to when they feel the lack of authenticity in their messaging, vision, and lifestyle. No fancy sales funnels and pushy marketing in this household. I help them systemize their workflow, marketing, and content so they can work for 2 hours a day, charge more, and sell their products & services without manual effort.</p>
			<p>Dan Koe is an <em><strong><i>American writer</i>, advisor, and co-founder of Kortex, a company that focuses on increasing productivity, creativity, and profitability.</strong></em> In addition, he is also a prolific writer and has written books that have sold very well globally. In this article, we take a close look at everything you need to know about Koe and his career.</p>
			<p>In the realm of digital influence, Dan Koe stands as a luminary brand advisor for 6-7 figure creators and influencers, the go-to strategist when transitioning from a struggling artist to a highly paid internet phenomenon. Renowned for his ability to revolutionize workflows, marketing approaches, and content strategies, Dan empowers his clientele to toil for a mere two hours daily while commanding higher fees and effortlessly selling their products and services on autopilot.</p>

			<h2>What type of stories does Dan Koe tell?</h2>
			<h4>“The highest-paid individuals are the strategists, visionaries, and true creatives of the world.” - Dan Koe
				You let down yourself, you let down others by limiting your conception of:
				1) Your world
				2)Yourself
				“By letting your attention be stolen from you” you achieve this state of ambiguity, of inevitable downfall.
				Isn´t it a compelling reflection? I mean, how many times did your lack of focus changed the way you approached certain things?
				How many times do you snooze that alarm of yours in hopes your “future” 5-minute self will have the strength and clarity to wake up.
				Focus is the name of the game.
				And for Dan Koe is the currency we use in life.
				The online world is all about this: trade your focus and energy in exchange of accomplishments, accountability, fame, or visibility. That´s cheap focus.</h4>
